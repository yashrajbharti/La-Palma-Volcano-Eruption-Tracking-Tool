Also, you can switch languages there at your convenience. \n⬧ Then go to the Track tab and tap on the Track you want to visualize. Wait for the \"Ready to visualize\" Toast message to appear, then hit the \"Visualize in LG\" button. You will be able to see the desired visualization in the Liquid Galaxy rig. \n⬧ You can navigate through the LG from the Map tab, learn what the icons and colored polygons stand for from the \"Info Tab\", and Clean or Save the visualization with the help of \"LG Tasks\" from the menu.",

Hit the \"Visualize in LG\" button once more to solve this.",

		"points3": "⬧ To Navigate in the LG rig, one can use the interface of the Map screen in the following ways: \n⬧ To Drag, we can use one finger movement in any direction in the Map screen. \n⬧ To Twist at an angle, one can use two fingers and give a screw movement in the Map screen. \n⬧ To Zoom, one can pinch the screen and move the fingers outwards or inwards to zoom in and zoom out, respectively. We can also zoom by pressing the + and - icons provided on the Map screen. \n⬧ To Tilt, one can use two fingers and give it linear movement in an upward direction.",
